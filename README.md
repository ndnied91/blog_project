# blog project


full stack blog project 


ReactJS from all front end 
Redux for state management 

NodeJS for backend 
MongoDB for datbase


this site is no where near finalized 

still needs to be styled with a few logical fixes/changes 

site takes a bit to load due to heroku starting up the react app, so please be patient (will be fixed on production)
